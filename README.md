# Go to Finder

> Open the Finder or reveal favorite folders quickly

## Description

Inspired by [How I use Alfred.](https://youtu.be/4YreMtfehE4?t=1276) by [The Productivity Shop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwT-01b-VJ0U3dViux7beeg).

The example in the video reminded me of the Windows + E command, which I use on Windows whenever I use PCs.

I've extended that idea a bit by a quick menu to jump directly into one of the most common folders.

## Setup

To setup your own favorite folders, open the node called `finder` and edit the list.

## Usage

Use one hotkey (default: ⌥ + E) to open the Finder like you would open the Explorer in Windows.

Use another hotkey (default: ⌥ + F) to open a list of your favorite folders and reveal one of them.
